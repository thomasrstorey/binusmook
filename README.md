# binusmook

A chrome extenstion that removes all the visual content from a facebook, leaving the framework of the page.

## Update: 2/18/2020

Someone from facebook reached out to me to ask me to rebrand/rename/remove this extension from the chrome webstore, which I have done. This little art project used to be known as "minusbook" but because that has "book" as a suffix that apparently infringes on facebook's intellectual property.
